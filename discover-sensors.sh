# GPU. Vendors expose different subsets, so each sensor is probed on its own
# rather than gated behind one capability:
#
#   amdgpu        gpu_busy_percent, hwmon temperature (temp1_input), mem_info_vram_*
#   i915          hwmon temperature only (temp1_input); no device-wide busy
#                 counter exists in sysfs, utilisation needs the PMU or
#                 per-client fdinfo
#   xe            hwmon temperature only, but as temp2_input: xe's hwmon ABI
#                 numbers package temp starting at 2, there is no temp1 (see
#                 Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-driver-intel-xe-hwmon)
#   nouveau       hwmon temperature only (temp1_input)
#   NVIDIA prop.  nothing readable via sysfs at all, not even temperature —
#                 every reading requires NVML (nvidia-smi), which means a
#                 helper process. Deliberately left unsupported rather than
#                 spawning one per sample.
#
# Cards are ranked so one publishing utilisation wins outright, then by video
# memory. That keeps the discrete adapter on hybrid systems without hardcoding
# device IDs, and still reports a temperature-only card when it is all there is.
# Overridable so the discovery logic can be exercised against fixture trees
# that stand in for hardware this machine does not have.
